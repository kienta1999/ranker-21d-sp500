description: Rebalance the IBKR account toward the latest picks CSV through the free web Client Portal instead of the paid IBKR Pro API — Playwright drives the logged-in portal session for positions, quotes and order placement. Use when the user says /ibkr-web-trade, or asks to rebalance / place the picks / trade the picks without IB Gateway.

# IBKR web trade (no API)

Does exactly what this used to do:

```
uv run python scripts/execute_picks.py --port 4001 --mode live --leverage 1.35 --vol-target 0.2 --sector-cap 0.40 --top-n 40
```

…but with no IB Gateway and no IBKR Pro market-data subscription. The account
state, the quotes and the order tickets all come from the logged-in Client
Portal session in Playwright. Sizing, reconciliation, the vol-target overlay
and the notional circuit breaker are the **same** `scripts/execute_picks.py`
code, run as `--broker web`.

**Default = real execution** of that command against account `U26645119`
(LIVE, real money) using the newest `picks/picks_*.csv`. Any flag the user
names — `--mode whatif`, `--top-n 20`, a specific picks file, a different
`--leverage` — overrides that default and is passed straight through.

## Non-negotiables

1. **Never submit an order without the user's explicit go-ahead in chat.**
   Exactly two gates, both required, whatever the order count: the plan
   (step 6), then the final confirmation (step 7b). Never ask per order —
   40 orders still means two questions, not 41. `place_orders.js` already
   auto-replies to IBKR's own per-order confirmation prompts.
2. The user types their own username/password. Never ask for them, never store
   them, never type into the login form.
3. In live mode, cancel working orders **before** reading positions. A stale
   limit that fills after the read makes the plan re-buy what is already held.
4. Never re-run the placement step "to be sure". Read the order book back
   instead (step 8).
5. If any step returns an error, stop and report it. Do not improvise around a
   failed order.

## Steps

Work from the repo root:
`/home/talekien1710/personal_project/investment_strategy/ranker-21d-sp500`.

### 1. Settle the parameters

Defaults, unless the user said otherwise:

| | default |
|---|---|
| picks | newest `picks/picks_*.csv` (`ls -t picks/picks_*.csv \| head -1`) |
| mode | `live` |
| leverage | `1.35` |
| vol-target | `0.2` |
| sector-cap | `0.40` |
| top-n | `40` |
| account | `U26645119` |

`--sector-cap 0.40` caps any one GICS sector at 40% of the basket. Swept
2026-09-01 at leverage 1.35 / vol-target 0.20 over 2021–2026: 0.40 weakly
dominates no cap (CAGR +27.14% vs +26.94%, Sharpe 0.96 vs 0.95, MaxDD
−28.94% vs −29.19%), while 0.20 costs 3.3 CAGR points. The margin at 0.40 is
inside the rebalance-offset noise band, so treat it as a free sector ceiling
rather than measured alpha. `run_all.py` already applies it when it writes
the picks file; passing it here re-caps a picks file generated before
2026-09-01, and is a no-op on a file that is already capped.

`--top-n 40` is the backtest canonical. 20 backtests better and halves fixed
order costs, but is UNVERIFIED in the leave-2008-out stress test — so it is an
explicit ask, never the default.

Call the flags `$FLAGS` below:
`--broker web --mode <mode> --leverage <lev> --vol-target <vt> --sector-cap <cap> --top-n <n> [--picks <file>]`

### 2. Open the portal and check the session

`browser_navigate` to
`https://portal.interactivebrokers.com/portal/?loginType=1&action=ACCT_MGMT_MAIN#/portfolio`

Then `browser_evaluate`:

```js
async () => (await fetch('/portal.proxy/v1/portal/iserver/auth/status', {credentials:'include'})).json()
```

If `authenticated` is not `true`, tell the user to log in in the open browser
window (they handle 2FA) and wait for them to say they are done. Re-check
before continuing.

### 3. Cancel working orders — live mode only

Read `cancel_orders.js`, replace `__ACCOUNT__`, run it with `browser_evaluate`.
If `still_working` comes back non-empty, **stop**: report the names and ask the
user to clear them in the portal.

### 4. Which tickers

```bash
uv run python scripts/execute_picks.py $FLAGS --dump-tickers | tail -1
```

### 5. Capture the account

Read `capture_state.js`, replace `__ACCOUNT__` and `__TICKERS__` (a JS array
literal built from step 4), and run it with `browser_evaluate` using
`filename: "web_account.json"` so the JSON never lands in context. Playwright
writes it to the repo root — move it into place:

```bash
mv web_account.json reports/web_account.json
python3 -c "import json;d=json.load(open('reports/web_account.json'));print(d['account'],d['equity'],len(d['positions']),'missing:',d['missing'],'working:',d['working_orders'])"
```

Report `missing` (names with no quote — they get skipped) and any
`working_orders` to the user. Note `equity` = NetLiquidation.

### 6. Build the plan and show it

```bash
uv run python scripts/execute_picks.py $FLAGS
```

This places nothing. It prints the plan table and, for `whatif`/`live`, writes
`reports/web_orders.json` (sells first, marketable DAY limits 50 bps through
the reference price, one `coid` per order).

Show the user the plan table, the buy/sell totals, and the picks file it came
from — then **ask for confirmation to continue**. Stop here if the mode is
`print`.

If the script aborts on the price sanity check (a quote far from the cached
close = a non-US listing resolved), stop and report which ticker.

### 7. Cost preview, then place

Read `place_orders.js`. Substitute `__ACCOUNT__`, `__ORDERS__` (the `orders`
array from `reports/web_orders.json`, verbatim) and `__WHATIF__`.

**7a — `__WHATIF__ = true`.** IBKR returns commission and margin impact per
order and places nothing. Summarise total commission and the equity/margin
after. If the mode is `whatif`, **stop here** — done.

**7b — final confirmation.** Show the user: account `U26645119` (LIVE, real
money), order count, gross buy and sell notional, estimated commission. Ask
plainly whether to submit. Only a clear yes proceeds.

**7c — `__WHATIF__ = false`.** Run it again. Each order is submitted and its
confirmation prompts auto-replied. Report per-ticker: `order_id` / status, and
anything that came back with an `error`.

### 8. Record the book

```bash
uv run python scripts/execute_picks.py --broker web --record-book
```

Stamps `reports/live_book.json` with the intended gross exposure —
`scripts/today.py`'s daily de-risk check reads it. Live mode only.

### 9. Report

Read `final_report.js`, replace `__ACCOUNT__`, run it with `browser_evaluate`
using `filename: "web_final.json"`, then:

```bash
mv web_final.json reports/web_final.json
python3 - <<'EOF'
import json
a = json.load(open('reports/web_final.json'))
b = json.load(open('reports/live_book.json'))          # pre-trade equity + target
before, after = b['equity'], a['netliq']
tgt, act = b['gross_exposure'], a['gross'] / a['netliq']
print(f"NetLiq before   ${before:>12,.2f}")
print(f"NetLiq after    ${after:>12,.2f}   ({after-before:+,.2f})")
print(f"Gross exposure  ${a['gross']:>12,.2f}   {act:.3f}x  (target {tgt:.2f}x, "
      f"shortfall {(tgt-act)*before:+,.0f})")
print(f"Margin loan     ${a['loan']:>12,.2f}   {a['loan']/after*100:.1f}% of equity")
print(f"Positions {a['positions']}   day P&L {a['day_pnl']}   "
      f"excess liquidity ${a['excess_liquidity']:,.0f}")
print("unfilled:", a['unfilled'] or "none")
EOF
```

**Always show the user that block**, plus: working vs. filled orders (the `book`
list from 7c), anything rejected, anything skipped for a missing quote.

Actual gross almost always lands *under* target — whole-share rounding on a
small account, worst on high-priced names. Report the realized multiple, never
the target, as "your leverage".

Market closed → limits sit as DAY orders and expire unfilled if never touched;
say so, and note that re-running the skill reconciles whatever did not fill.

## Notes

- `reports/web_account.json` goes stale fast; `--mode live` refuses it past 60
  minutes. Re-run step 5 rather than editing the timestamp.
- The portal quotes `mktPrice` for held names free of charge and mark/last for
  the rest; Yahoo only fills gaps the portal left empty.
- Re-running the whole skill after partial fills is safe and is the intended
  way to finish a rebalance — it re-reads positions and re-diffs.
- Account `U27177562` also exists on this login. It is **not** this strategy's
  account — it holds `conviction-pick-sp500`'s dip basket, traded by that
  repo's `/stock-pick-dip-execute` (which reuses this skill's JS and
  `execute_picks.py` with `EXEC_REPORTS_DIR` pointed at its own `reports/`).
  Never trade it from here.
